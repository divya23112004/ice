This is a simple and responsive Ice Cream Shop website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to showcase a variety of ice cream products, their features, and an easy way for users to navigate through the website. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionality of the code:

1. Head Section
The <head> section contains essential meta tags for defining the character set (utf-8), viewport settings for responsive design, and the page title "Ice Cream Shop."
External stylesheets and scripts are linked to enhance the visual design and functionality:
Bootstrap CSS: Used for responsive layout and pre-built components.
Font Awesome: Provides icons like social media links, phone, email, and search icons.
Custom CSS (style.css): Additional styling specific to the Ice Cream Shop's branding (not provided here, but assumed to exist in the project).
2. Navigation Bar (Navbar)
